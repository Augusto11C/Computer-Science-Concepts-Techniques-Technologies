# SOLID

## Single Responsibility Principal

**Definition:**  There should not be more than one reason for a class to change, or  **a class should always handle single functionality**.

**Main goal:**  To avoid introducing coupling between functionalities, because there is a chance of breaking coupled functionality when changes are made in of of them. That will require another round of testing to avoid any surprise on the production environment.

## Open Closed

**Definition:**  Classes, methods or functions should be Open for extension (new functionality) and Closed for modification.  
**Main goal:**  To prevent someone from changing already tried and tested code.
