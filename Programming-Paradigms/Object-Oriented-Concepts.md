## The Object Model

### Objects Definition
- Stefik and Bobrow define objects as "entities that combine the properties of procedures and data since they perform computations and save local state".
- Objects serve to unify the ideas of algorithmic and data abstraction.
- There exist invariant properties that characterize an object and its behavior.
    -  "An elevator, for example, is characterized by invariant properties including [that] it only travels up and down inside its shaft. Any elevator simulation must incorporate these invariants, for they are integral to the notion of an elevator"


### Object-Oriented Programming
> Object-oriented programming is a method of implementation in which programs are organized as cooperative collections of objects, each of which represents an instance of some class, and whose classes are all members of a hierarchy of classes united via inheritance relationships.

- Object-oriented programming uses objects, not algorithms, as its fundamental logical building blocks.
- Each object is an instance of some class.
- Classes may be related to one another via inheritance relationships.

### Object-Oriented Language - Features
A language is object-oriented if and only if it satisfies the following requirements:
- It supports objects that are data abstractions with an interface of named operations and a hidden local state.
- Objects have an associated type [class].
- Types [classes] may inherit attributes from supertypes [superclasses].

### Object-Oriented Design
> Object-oriented design is a method of design encompassing the process of object-oriented decomposition and a notation for depicting both logical and physical as well as static and dynamic models of the system under design.

- object-oriented design leads to an object-oriented decomposition
- uses different notations to express different models of the logical (class and object structure) and physical (module and process architecture) design of a system, in addition to the static and dynamic aspects of the system.


### Object-Oriented Analysis
- Object-oriented analysis (OOA) emphasizes the building of real-world models, using an object-oriented view of the world:

> Object-oriented analysis is a method of analysis that examines requirements from the perspective of the classes and objects found in the vocabulary of the problem domain.


### How are OOA, OOD, and OOP related?
The products of **object-oriented analysis** serve as the models from which an object-oriented design can be started. The products of object-oriented design can then be used as blueprints for completely implementing a system using object-oriented programming method
